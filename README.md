## Scope
Tuberculosis is the fifth greatest cause of death worldwide, with around 10 million new
cases and 1.5 million fatalities per year. As one of the world's most serious hazards and a
relatively simple remedy, the World Health Organization advocates systematic and
widespread screening to eradicate the disease. Despite its limited specificity and complex
interpretation, posteroanterior chest radiography is one of the most commonly used
tuberculosis screening methods. Unfortunately, because tuberculosis is largely a disease of
developing nations, clinical officers trained to interpret these chest X-rays are
usually insufficient. In these conditions, an automated tuberculosis diagnosis algorithm could
be a low-cost and effective way to make extensive tuberculosis screening a reality.

## Classification Workflow
The Classification workflow begins with data exploration to comprehend the data. The dataset is afterward divided into training, testing, and validation groups, accordingly. The model is trained on the training set. After training and validation, testing dataset authentication is carried out to
assess the model's whole classification accuracy. At the end, the outcomes of model are then analyzed and contrasted in the form of Confusion Matrix and Accuracy achieved by themodel.
